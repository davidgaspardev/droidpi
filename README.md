# DroiDPI

Take image informed by the user and process them for all standard sizes of mobile devices. Both architectures for Flutter and for native Android.

## What do I want to do with this ?

I'm a mobile developer, and I always have to deal with performance on more humble devices, to collaborate with performance I need to resize my icons in five different sizes (mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi and xxxhdpi).

It's always been a pain in the ass, but it's important, that's why I want to create this!

For always enjoying low-level development, came the idea of combining business with pleasure. Develop a binary that optimizes my work.
